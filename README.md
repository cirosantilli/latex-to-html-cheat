# LaTeX to HTML

Tools that convert LaTeX to HTML.

A single input file [main.tex](main.tex) will be used to test all compilers.

This file shall only contain features which we feel are fundamental for publishing the generated documents in HTML, and for which there is an obvious good HTML output. 

Tested with TeX Live 2013 + the HTML converters.
